```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(blavaan, quietly=TRUE)
```

This page contains some tips for getting started with the *blavaan* package.

### Installation
*blavaan* can be installed from CRAN in the usual way:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("blavaan")
```

In some situations, you may wish to install *blavaan* from GitHub. The GitHub version sometimes contains bug fixes that are not yet on CRAN, though it can also be less stable. To install from GitHub, use the following command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ecmerkle/blavaan", INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch")
```

This command requires that your system can compile Stan models, which is not guaranteed if you usually install *blavaan* from CRAN. If you are having trouble, it may help to look at the [RStan Getting Started page.](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)


### Commands and Syntax
The *blavaan* package depends on the *lavaan* package for model specification and for some computations. This means that, if you already know *lavaan*, then you should already be able to do many things in *blavaan*. In particular, many *blavaan* commands add the letter "b" to the start of the *lavaan* command. For example, `sem()` becomes `bsem()`, and `lavInspect()` becomes `blavInspect()`. It is also sometimes possible to use a *lavaan* command on a *blavaan* object, though the results may not always be what you expect.

With these details in mind, look at the [lavaan tutorial](https://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/index.html) for many examples of models. You can translate many of those examples to *blavaan* by adding a "b" to the start of the commands. And look at the other pages here, to learn about the additional *blavaan* arguments that are specific to Bayesian methods.
